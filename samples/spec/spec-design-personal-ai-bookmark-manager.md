# Introduction

This specification defines the requirements, constraints, and interfaces for a personal, AI-powered bookmark manager application. The solution is designed for individual users who want a fun, visually engaging, and intelligent way to organize, preview, and discover web bookmarks, with offline support and a browser extension interface.

## 1. Purpose & Scope

The purpose of this specification is to guide the development of a minimal viable product (MVP) for a personal bookmark manager that leverages AI for automatic organization and recommendations. The scope includes a desktop-focused web application and browser extension, with core features for saving, visualizing, organizing, and exporting bookmarks. Intended for developers and designers building the application.

## 2. Definitions

- **AI**: Artificial Intelligence, used for grouping, tagging, and recommending bookmarks.
- **MVP**: Minimum Viable Product, the simplest version of the app that is usable and testable.
- **WebExtensions API**: Standard browser extension API for Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.
- **IndexedDB**: Browser-based database for offline storage.
- **Visual Preview**: Thumbnail or summary of a bookmarked web page.
- **Tag**: User- or AI-generated label for categorizing bookmarks.
- **Export**: Download of bookmarks in a portable format (e.g., JSON).

## 3. Requirements, Constraints & Guidelines

- **REQ-001**: The app shall allow users to save, view, and organize bookmarks via a browser extension and web interface.
- **REQ-002**: The app shall provide visual previews (thumbnails or summaries) for each bookmark.
- **REQ-003**: The app shall use AI to suggest tags, categories, and groupings for bookmarks.
- **REQ-004**: The app shall recommend new bookmarks based on the user’s collection.
- **REQ-005**: The app shall support offline access to all core features.
- **REQ-006**: The app shall allow users to export and back up their bookmarks.
- **REQ-007**: The app shall include fun, engaging animations in the UI.
- **SEC-001**: The app shall store all user data locally by default and handle AI API keys securely.
- **SEC-002**: The app shall not transmit user data to third parties without explicit consent.
- **CON-001**: The MVP shall not require a backend server for core features.
- **GUD-001**: Use React + TypeScript for the UI, Framer Motion for animations, and Dexie.js for IndexedDB access.
- **GUD-002**: Use the WebExtensions API (Manifest V3) for browser integration.
- **PAT-001**: Modularize code for future feature expansion (e.g., sync, sharing).

## 4. Interfaces & Data Contracts

### Browser Extension Interface

- Save current page as bookmark
- Show popup with visual preview, tags, and quick actions

### Web App Interface

- List, search, and filter bookmarks
- Visual grid/list with previews and tags
- Settings for export/backup

### Data Model (Example)

```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "url": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "preview": "string (image or summary)",
  "tags": ["string"],
  "createdAt": "ISO8601 timestamp",
  "aiMetadata": {
    "categories": ["string"],
    "suggested": true
  }
}
```

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC-001**: Given a user saves a bookmark, when the extension is used, then the bookmark appears in the web app with a visual preview and suggested tags.
- **AC-002**: The app shall function with no internet connection for all core features (view, organize, export bookmarks).
- **AC-003**: When the user requests recommendations, the app suggests relevant bookmarks based on their collection.
- **AC-004**: When the user exports bookmarks, a valid JSON file is downloaded.
- **AC-005**: No user data is sent to third parties without explicit consent.

## 6. Test Automation Strategy

- **Test Levels**: Unit (data model, UI components), Integration (extension ↔ web app), End-to-End (user flows)
- **Frameworks**: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright
- **Test Data Management**: Use mock data for AI and bookmarks; clean up after each test
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated tests run in GitHub Actions on push and PR
- **Coverage Requirements**: ≥80% code coverage for MVP
- **Performance Testing**: Simulate large bookmark collections for UI and search performance

## 7. Rationale & Context

This design prioritizes a delightful user experience and leverages AI to reduce manual organization effort. Offline-first architecture ensures reliability. The MVP avoids backend complexity, focusing on local-first features and privacy.

## 8. Dependencies & External Integrations

### External Systems

- **EXT-001**: Browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) – runs extension and web app

### Third-Party Services

- **SVC-001**: AI service (e.g., OpenAI, Azure AI) – for content analysis and recommendations

### Infrastructure Dependencies

- **INF-001**: None required for MVP (local storage only)

### Data Dependencies

- **DAT-001**: Web page metadata (title, preview image, etc.) – fetched at save time

### Technology Platform Dependencies

- **PLT-001**: React, TypeScript, Dexie.js, Framer Motion, WebExtensions API

### Compliance Dependencies

- **COM-001**: User consent for any data sent to AI or third-party services

## 9. Examples & Edge Cases

```json
// Example: Bookmark with missing preview
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "title": "Example Site",
  "preview": null,
  "tags": ["news"],
  "createdAt": "2025-07-04T12:00:00Z",
  "aiMetadata": {
    "categories": ["technology"],
    "suggested": false
  }
}
```

## 10. Validation Criteria

- All requirements in section 3 are implemented and testable.
- Automated tests pass for all acceptance criteria.
- Manual review confirms UI is fun and engaging.
- Security review confirms no data leaks or privacy issues.
